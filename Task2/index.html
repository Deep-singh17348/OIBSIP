            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p><span>K</span>enneth Henry Jarvis Miles (1 November 1918 – 17 August 1966) was a British sports car racing engineer 
                and driver best known for his motorsport career in the US and with American teams on the international scene. 
                He is an inductee to the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.<br>
            <br>
            Ken Miles was key in Ford’s triumph at Le Mans in 1966, developing and racing the Ford GT40, as depicted in the film Le Mans ’66.
             He also developed the Shelby Cobra. But Miles is also known for missing out on the Le Mans win in 1966; he gave up a dominant lead in an effort to ensure a tied finish with the second-placed GT40, 
             driven by Bruce McLaren, which went on to be awarded the victory.</p>

                <div class="bio">
                    <div>
                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>Miles was born on 1 November 1918 in Sutton Coldfield, then in Warwickshire, now in the city of Birmingham.
                            He was the son of Eric Miles and Clarice Jarvis.[2] After a failed attempt to run away to the United States,
                             Miles left school at the age of 15 to work as an apprentice at Wolseley Motors,
                              who sent him to a technical school to broaden his knowledge of vehicle construction.
                             He raced motorcycles before joining the British Army, during World War II.<br>
                             <br>

                            Miles' first role in the military was driving instructor in Territorial Army.
                             On 1 October 1942, as an armament artificer, he was among the founding members of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME), and transferred to the REME Training Establishment.
                              The following year Miles was posted to Guards Armoured Division Workshops, followed by the 29th Armoured Brigade Workshop.<br>
                               He landed in Normandy on 15 June 1944, and later that year was posted to the Light Aid Detachment of the 15th/19th King’s Royal Hussars.
                                Miles served in North West Europe until the end of the war, by which time he had achieved the rank of staff sergeant.
                                 He served as a tank commander, and the experience is said to have fuelled a new love in Miles for high-performance engineering. He was discharged to the reserves on 1 April 1946.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Racing career</h4>
                        <p>After the war, Miles raced Bugattis, Alfa Romeos, and Alvises with the Vintage Sports Car Club. He then turned to a Ford V8 Frazer-Nash.
                            In 1952 Miles moved from England to the US, and settled in Los Angeles, California as a service manager for Gough Industries, the Southern California MG distributor.
                             In 1953, he won 14 straight victories in SCCA racing in an MG-based special of his own design and construction.<br>
                             <br>
                            
                            For the 1955 season, he designed, constructed and campaigned a second special based on MG components that was known as the "Flying Shingle". It was very successful in the SCCA F modified class on the west coast. Miles raced the "Flying Shingle" at Palm Springs in late March,
                             finishing first overall against veteran driver Cy Yedor, also in an MG Special, and novice driver, actor James Dean in a Porsche 356 Speedster. Miles was later disqualified on a technical infraction because his fenders were too wide, thus allowing Yedor and Dean to get 'bumped up' to first and second. 
                             During 1956, Miles raced John von Neumann's Porsche 550 Spyder at most of the Cal Club and SCCA events.<br>
                             
                             <br>
                             The French race officials, after initially agreeing to Ford's dead-heat "photo-finish", reneged during the final hour of the race. Although Miles's #1 car and McLaren's #2 car crossed the finish line together, McLaren's #2 was declared the winner because having started in second position behind Miles's car,
                              it had therefore covered 8 meters more distance during the race.Miles was denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the same year.</p>

                        <h4>Death and Legacy</h4>
                        <p>The Ford J-car was intended to be the successor to the Ford GT40 Mk II and, despite reliability problems, showed potential in the springtime Le Mans trials. After the death of Walt Hansgen in a J-car while testing at Le Mans in April,
                             Ford decided to shelve the J-car and focus on the proven Mk IIs. Little development was done for the rest of the 1966 World Sports Car Championship season. In August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development work with Miles as primary test driver. 
                             The J-car featured a breadvan-shaped rear section experimenting with Kammback aerodynamic theories, and a honeycomb panel design supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car, but the design was unproven with high-speed prototype sports cars.<br></p>
                             <br>
                        <p>After almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the very hot Southern California desert, Miles approached the end of the track's one-mile (1.6 km) downhill back straight at top speed—over 200 miles per hour (320 km/h)—when the car suddenly flipped, crashed, and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly.</p>
